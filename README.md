# Firestore
A useful sample project for who wants to use Firestore with clean architecture.

## How did i implement this project ?
I used **MVVM architecture** with **LiveData-ViewModel**, **Kotlin-Coroutines**, **Dagger2** and **Navigation-Component**
for transaction between fragments.

## Packages and folders:
### 1. data :
Models, repositories and data sources are available inside of this package.

### 2. di :
All modules, qualifiers and etc. are defined here.

### 3. ui :
ViewModels, Fragments, Dialogs and base classes (like BaseViewModel) are available inside of this package.

If you have any question or face with an issued, please don't hesitate to ask me or leave an issue in this
repository.
